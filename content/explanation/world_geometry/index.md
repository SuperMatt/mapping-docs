World Geometry is the term used to describe the walls, floors, and ceilings that make up the level in a Quake engine game. The world geometry is made up of brushes, which are solid objects that define the shape of the level. Brushes can be textured with different materials to create the appearance of walls, floors, and ceilings.

The world geometry is used to define the layout of the level, and to create the spaces that the player can move through. The world geometry is also used to define the collision boundaries of the level, so that the player can't walk through walls or fall through the floor.
